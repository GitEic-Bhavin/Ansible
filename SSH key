Ansible SSH keys

If you are using SSH Keys – there are 2 part of SSH

1. Private key – Located to your ansible Bydefault directory “/home/user_name/.ssh/Private_key”    ex. bhavin     is a private key

2. Public key – located to your remote server / EC2 Instance Bydefault directory “/home/user_name/.ssh/Public_key”    ex. bhavin.pub     is a public key

To generate SSH Key for ansible to remote connection use below command
“ SSH-keygen ”

It will ask for your SSH Key file directory -- .ssh
			SSH Key file name – bhavin


You will have bhavin – Private key & bhavin.pub – public key on your ansible default directory /.ssh

you have to give file permission 600 for both pub & pri key

You have to copy .pub file into your remote server, follow below steps
- Give file permission 600 for both .pub & pri key.
- Copy content of .pub file which is created by “SSH-keygen”
- Login into your remote server by regular use of .pem file by SSH connections.
- Go to directory /home/user_name/.ssh/admin_key
- Open admin_key file, it is .pub file & delete content.
- Paste your copy content of .pub file ( which is craeted by “SSH-keygen” ) .
- Go to directory /home/user_name & give file permission 600.

- Come back to your ansible where your inventory & playbook is located. Not bydefault directory.
-  Make Hosts file
	 web1 ansible_host=43.204.140.111 ansible_connection=ssh ansible_private_key=/root/.ssh/id_rsa ansible_user=ubuntu

- Make Playbook.yml
-
  name: install nginx
  hosts: web1
  become: yes
  tasks: 
    - name: install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
    - name: install mysql-server
      apt:
       name: mysql-server
       state: present

Connect to remote server by ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

you will be connected & tasks will be run on remote server which is defined in playbook.yml



Crate a direactory into your remote server
Make playbook.yml

- name: “Create a directory into remote server”
   hosts: all
   become: yes
   file:
     path: ./basic-http-server
     state: direactory

# here, “ . ” is a current directory
# /basic-http-server is a directory name will be created.

That’s It!
