                       2. SCRIPT MODULE

                         - if you want to run a script on a 1000 servers. you have to upload this script by ansible. 
                         - ansible will copy this script within all 1000 servers and EXECUTE scipt on all servers.

                           tasks:								  
                             - name: Start the database service

                                    hosts: localhost
                                    tasks:
                                      - lineinfile:
                                          path: /etc/resolv.conf
                                          line: 'nameserver 10.1.250.10'
                                          
                                          
                                          
      THIS THING IF WE PERFORM BY echo "nameserver 10.1.250.10" >> apend to resolv.conf
                                
      It will do entry or add this line at every time which is not desirable,
                                
      If we do by lineinfile MODULE -- It will do Entry or add a line if it is not  existing.
