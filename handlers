What is Handlers in Ansible ?

Your web or app is hosting on your server.
Servers have a hosting server like nginx, http , my-sql-server, rds-server etc.

You need to update a content of your file on your server,
You need to update a software or DB server on your server.
You need to get notification by email by handler when handlers tasks is triggered.

After update your software of content, you need to restart the DB-server, or nginx server.

To perform/handle this type of things at each time by automatically, use HANDLERS.

What tasks should be done by handlers ? It is defined by attribute is “ notify: ”.

Hosts file
web1 ansible_host=43.204.140.111 ansible_connection=ssh ansible_private_key=/root/.ssh/id_rsa ansible_user=ubuntu

Inventory > Role > Tasks > playbook.yml , handler-playbook.yml , index.html , updated.html

# This is role file. You can define role and handlers in one playbook.yml

---
- name: “Update apt cache and install Nginx”
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: latest
    update_cache: yes

- name: index.html copy
  template: src=index.html dest=/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

# Update the content on the website
- name: updated.html copy
  template: src=updated.html dest=/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
  notify:
    - Restart Nginx





# This is handlers file “ handler-playbook.yml”

---
- name: “Example ansible playbook for handers”
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  remote_user: ubuntu
  roles:
    - handlers

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Nginx
      service: name=nginx state=restarted


# in “handlers: ” you have to write a proper name of tasks perform by handlers.
# - name: Restart Nginx is a tasks name , it should be write in roles playbook.yml file as same syntax of tasks defined in handlers file.

# handler ma tame Restart Nginx lakhelu chhe to tamare role file ma,
    
   notify:
     - Restart Nginx 
# aavu j lakhvu pade. That mean, notify will call handlers name = Restart Nginx in handlers playbook.yml

Now, Run the playbook.yml

ansible-playbook   -i  inventory  ansible-handler-playbook.yml
