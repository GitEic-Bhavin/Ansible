You've been given a playbook named database_setup.yml that is supposed to set up a PostgreSQL database on your servers. 
Before deploying it, you want to ensure that it adheres to best practices and doesn't have any style-related issues.


The initial sample playbook is as follows:

- name: Database Setup Playbook
  hosts: db_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed
      apt:
        name: postgresql
        state: latest
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Start PostgreSQL service
      service:
        name: postgresql
        state: started

    - copy:
        src: /path/to/pg_hba.conf
        dest: /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf
      notify:
        - Restart PostgreSQL

Which command would you use to run ansible-lint on the database_setup.yml playbook?


A. ansible database_setup.yml --lint
B. ansible-lint database_setup.yml
C. ansible-playbook database_setup.yml --lint
D. lint-ansible database_setup.yml
