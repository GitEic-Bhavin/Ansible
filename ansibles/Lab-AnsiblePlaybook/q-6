q-6 A sample playbook named update_service.yml is shown below, it is supposed to update a service on your servers.

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install a new package
      apt:
        name: new_package
        state: present

    - name: Update the service
      service:
        name: my_service
        state: restarted

    - name: Check service status
      service:
        name: my_service
        state: started

Which command would you use to run update_service.yml playbook in check mode?

A-7 ansible-playbook -i inventory update_service.yml --check
