q-8 There is another sample playbook named configure_database.
yml that modifies a configuration file on your database servers. \
The initial code sample is as follows:

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Set max connections
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf
        line: 'max_connections = 500'

    - name: Set listen addresses
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf
        line: 'listen_addresses = "*"'

Which command would you use to run the configure_database.yml playbook in both check mode and diff mode?

A-8 ansible-playbook configure_database.yml --check --diff
