q-18 So far, we have been running all tasks on localhost. 
We would now like to run these tasks on node01, this host is already defined in /home/bob/playbooks/inventory file. 
Update the playbook /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml to run the tasks on the node01 host.

---
- name: 'Execute two commands on node01'
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: 'Execute a date command'
      command: date
    - name: 'Task to display hosts file'
      command: 'cat /etc/hosts'


inventory file

node01 ansible_host=node01 ansible_ssh_pass=caleston123
node02 ansible_host=node02 ansible_ssh_pass=caleston123
[web_nodes]
node01
node02
