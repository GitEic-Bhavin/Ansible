q-7 Consider again the same sample playbook named update_service.yml as shown below.

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install a new package
      apt:
        name: new_package
        state: present

    - name: Update the service
      service:
        name: my_service
        state: restarted

    - name: Check service status
      service:
        name: my_service
        state: started

Let's suppose you have already ran this playbook on your server. 
Now, once you run this playbook in check mode against same server, which tasks would result in changed status?
