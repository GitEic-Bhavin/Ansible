The /home/bob/playbooks/app_install.yaml playbook is responsible for installing a list of packages on a remote server(s).
The list of packages to be installed is already added to the /home/bob/playbooks/inventory file as a list variable called app_list.

Right now the list of packages to be installed is hardcoded in the playbook.
Update the /home/bob/playbooks/app_install.yaml playbook to replace the hardcoded list of packages to use the values from the app_list variable defined in the inventory file.
Once updated, please run the playbook once to make sure it works fine.
