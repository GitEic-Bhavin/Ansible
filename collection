When you install an Ansible Collection for Nginx and WordPress configuration, it typically comes with pre-built roles,
modules, templates, and tasks tailored for setting up and configuring Nginx and WordPress.

You have to just use this collection in playbook. so this will call the collection which have pre-built roles, modules etc.

Let's break down what each component typically includes:

1. Roles
   - Roles are like sets of instructions or playbooks designed to perform specific tasks. In this case, the collection would include roles for Nginx and WordPress.
   - The Nginx role might contain tasks to install Nginx, start its service, and configure it as needed.
   - The WordPress role might include tasks to download WordPress, set it up in the appropriate directory, configure database settings, and perform other setup tasks.

2. Modules
   - Modules are small pieces of code that perform specific actions. In the collection, you might find custom modules designed to interact with Nginx and WordPress.
   - For example, there might be modules to manage Nginx configuration files or to interact with the WordPress database.

3. Templates
   - Templates are files with placeholders that get filled in with values during playbook execution. They're commonly used for generating configuration files.
   - The collection might include templates for Nginx configuration files, WordPress configuration files, and other relevant files.

4. Tasks
   - Tasks are individual steps that Ansible executes during playbook execution. They're like the specific actions that need to be performed to achieve the desired state.
   - The collection's tasks would include all the necessary steps
